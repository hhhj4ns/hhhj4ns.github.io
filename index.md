## Lets' go

My first topic to review is Privilege Escalation in Linux, here I leave several interesting links with a lot of content about it.

I don't speak or write in english but I will try.
To improve that point I am taking English classes.
I must confess that sometimes it's exhausting :) because of my level is not fluent at all.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hhhj4ns/hhhj4ns.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
